# C3 and C4 photosynthesis comparison

In my fourth-year research project, I focused on a comparative analysis of C3 and C4 photosynthesis at the proteomic level using a network-based approach. For this, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network modules responsible for C3 and C4 photosynthesis were extracted from the global PPI networks of rice and maize, respectively. Within each module, associated submodules and hubs were identified using the Louvain community detection algorithm, followed by inter- and intra-modular hub identification.

The second objective of this study was to compare the C3 and C4 PPI modules using a network alignment method. To achieve this, I used the AlignNemo algorithm, followed by the Louvain community detection algorithm, to extract the common PPIs and submodules between the two modules. To detect the C3 and C4-specific PPIs, the common PPIs identified were subtracted from the original C3 and C4 PPI modules. Depending on the presence of hub proteins previously identified in the individual networks, common and module-specific hub proteins were identified.ed. 

The ultimate goal of the research was to enhance our understanding of the transition from C3 to C4 plants by applying network analysis techniques to identify both shared and unique key proteins and functional modules involved in the photosynthesis pathways of C3 and C4 plants.
